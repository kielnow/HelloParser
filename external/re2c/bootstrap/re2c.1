.SH "NAME"
re2c \- convert regular expressions to C/C++
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBre2c\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIFILE\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBre2c\fR is a lexer generator for C/C++\&. It finds regular expression specifications inside of C/C++ comments and replaces them with a hard\-coded DFA\&. The user must supply some interface code in order to control and customize the generated DFA\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
Given the following code:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
unsigned int stou (const char * s)
{
#   define YYCTYPE char
    const YYCTYPE * YYCURSOR = s;
    unsigned int result = 0;

    for (;;)
    {
        /*!re2c
            re2c:yyfill:enable = 0;

            "\ex00" { return result; }
            [0\-9]  { result = result * 10 + c; continue; }
        */
    }
}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
re2c \-is will generate:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
/* Generated by re2c 0\&.13\&.7\&.dev on Mon Jul 14 13:37:46 2014 */
unsigned int stou (const char * s)
{
#   define YYCTYPE char
    const YYCTYPE * YYCURSOR = s;
    unsigned int result = 0;

    for (;;)
    {

{
        YYCTYPE yych;

        yych = *YYCURSOR;
        if (yych <= 0x00) goto yy3;
        if (yych <= \*(Aq/\*(Aq) goto yy2;
        if (yych <= \*(Aq9\*(Aq) goto yy5;

.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR
.RS 4
Implies
\fB\-s\fR\&. Use bit vectors as well in the attempt to coax better code out of the compiler\&. Most useful for specifications with more than a few keywords (e\&.g\&. for most programming languages)\&.
.RE

\fB\-c\fR
.RS 4
Used to support (f)lex\-like condition support\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Creates a parser that dumps information about the current position and in which state the parser is while parsing the input\&. This is useful to debug parser issues and states\&. If you use this switch you need to define a macro
\fBYYDEBUG\fR
that is called like a function with two parameters:
\fBvoid YYDEBUG (int state, char current)\fR\&. The first parameter receives the state or \-1 and the second parameter receives the input at the current cursor\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR
.RS 4
Emit Graphviz dot data\&. It can then be processed with e\&.g\&.
dot \-Tpng input\&.dot > output\&.png\&. Please note that scanners with many states may crash dot\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR
.RS 4
Generate a parser that supports EBCDIC\&. The generated code can deal with any character up to 0xFF\&. In this mode
\fBre2c\fR
assumes that input character size is 1 byte\&. This switch is incompatible with
\fB\-w\fR,
\fB\-x\fR,
\fB\-u\fR
and
\fB\-8\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Generate a scanner with support for storable state\&. For details see below at
\fBSCANNER WITH STORABLE STATES\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR
.RS 4
Partial support for flex syntax\&. When this flag is active then named definitions must be surrounded by curly braces and can be defined without an equal sign and the terminating semi colon\&. Instead names are treated as direct double quoted strings\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g\fR
.RS 4
Generate a scanner that utilizes GCC\(cqs computed goto feature\&. That is
\fBre2c\fR
generates jump tables whenever a decision is of a certain complexity (e\&.g\&. a lot of if conditions are otherwise necessary)\&. This is only useable with GCC and produces output that cannot be compiled with any other compiler\&. Note that this implies
\fB\-b\fR
and that the complexity threshold can be configured using the inplace configuration
\fBcgoto:threshold\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR
.RS 4
Do not output
\fB#line\fR
information\&. This is usefull when you want use a CMS tool with the
\fBre2c\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Allows reuse of scanner definitions with
\fB/*!use:re2c\fR
after
\fB/*!rules:re2c\fR\&. In this mode no
\fB/*!re2c\fR
block and exactly one
\fB/*!rules:re2c\fR
must be present\&. The rules are being saved and used by every
\fB/*!use:re2c\fR
block that follows\&. These blocks can contain inplace configurations, especially
\fBre2c:flags:e\fR,
\fBre2c:flags:w\fR,
\fBre2c:flags:x\fR,
\fBre2c:flags:u\fR
and
\fBre2c:flags:8\fR\&. That way it is possible to create the same scanner multiple times for different character types, different input mechanisms or different output mechanisms\&. The
\fB/*!use:re2c\fR
blocks can also contain additional rules that will be appended to the set of rules in
\fB/*!rules:re2c\fR\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR
.RS 4
Generate a parser that supports UTF\-32\&. The generated code can deal with any valid Unicode character up to 0x10FFFF\&. In this mode
\fBre2c\fR
assumes that input character size is 4 bytes\&. This switch is incompatible with
\fB\-e\fR,

Generate a parser that supports UCS\-2\&. The generated code can deal with any valid Unicode character up to 0xFFFF\&. In this mode
\fBre2c\fR
assumes that input character size is 2 bytes\&. This switch is incompatible with
\fB\-e\fR,
\fB\-x\fR,
\fB\-u\fR
and
\fB\-8\fR\&. This implies
\fB\-s\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR
.RS 4
Generate a parser that supports UTF\-16\&. The generated code can deal with any valid Unicode character up to 0x10FFFF\&. In this mode
\fBre2c\fR
assumes that input character size is 2 bytes\&. This switch is incompatible with
\fB\-e\fR,

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-encoding\-policy POLICY\fR
.RS 4
Specify how
\fBre2c\fR
must treat Unicode surrogates\&.
\fBPOLICY\fR
can be one of the following:
\fBfail\fR
(abort with error when surrogate encountered),
\fBsubstitute\fR
(silently substitute surrogate with error code point 0xFFFD),
\fBignore\fR
(treat surrogates as normal code points)\&. By default
\fBre2c\fR
ignores surrogates (for backward compatibility)\&. Unicode standard says that standalone surrogates are invalid code points, but different libraries and programs treat them differently\&.
.RE
.SH "INTERFACE CODE"
.sp
The user must supply interface code either in the form of C/C++ code (macros, functions, variables, etc\&.) or in the form of \fIinplace configurations\fR\&. Which symbols must be defined and which are optional depends on a particular use case\&.
.PP
\fBYYCONDTYPE\fR
.RS 4
In
\fB\-c\fR
mode you can use
\fB\-t\fR
to generate a file that contains the enumeration used as conditions\&. Each of the values refers to a condition of a rule set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYCTXMARKER\fR
.RS 4
l\-value of type
\fB* YYCTYPE\fR\&. The generated code saves trailing context backtracking information in
\fBYYCTXMARKER\fR\&. The user only needs to define this macro if a scanner specification uses trailing context in one or more of its regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYCTYPE\fR
.RS 4
Type used to hold an input symbol (code unit)\&. Usually
\fBchar\fR
or
\fBunsigned char\fR
for ASCII, EBCDIC and UTF\-8,
\fBunsigned short\fR
for UTF\-16 or UCS\-2 and
\fBunsigned int\fR
for UTF\-32\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYCURSOR\fR
.RS 4
l\-value of type
\fB* YYCTYPE\fR
that points to the current input symbol\&. The generated code advances
\fBYYCURSOR\fR
as symbols are matched\&. On entry,
\fBYYCURSOR\fR
is assumed to point to the first character of the current token\&. On exit,
\fBYYCURSOR\fR
will point to the first character of the following token\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYDEBUG (state, current)\fR
.RS 4
This is only needed if the
\fB\-d\fR
flag was specified\&. It allows to easily debug the generated parser by calling a user defined function for every state\&. The function should have the following signature:
\fBvoid YYDEBUG (int state, char current)\fR\&. The first parameter receives the state or \-1 and the second parameter receives the input at the current cursor\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
.RS 4
The generated code \(lqcalls\(rq
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
when the buffer needs (re)filling: at least
\fBn\fR
additional characters should be provided\&.
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
should adjust
\fBYYCURSOR\fR,
\fBYYLIMIT\fR,
\fBYYMARKER\fR
and
\fBYYCTXMARKER\fR
as needed\&. Note that for typical programming languages
\fBn\fR
will be the length of the longest keyword plus one\&. The user can place a comment of the form
\fB/*!max:re2c*/\fR
once to insert a
\fBYYMAXFILL (n)\fR
definition that is set to the maximum length value\&. If \-1 switch is used then
\fBYYMAXFILL\fR
can be triggered only once after the last
\fB/*!re2c \&.\&.\&. */\fR
block\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYGETCONDITION ()\fR
.RS 4
This define is used to get the condition prior to entering the scanner code when using
\fB\-c\fR
switch\&. The value must be initialized with a value from the enumeration
\fBYYCONDTYPE\fR
type\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYGETSTATE ()\fR
.RS 4
The user only needs to define this macro if the
\fB\-f\fR
flag was specified\&. In that case, the generated code \(lqcalls\(rq
\fBYYGETSTATE ()\fR
at the very beginning of the scanner in order to obtain the saved state\&.
\fBYYGETSTATE ()\fR
must return a signed integer\&. The value must be either \-1, indicating that the scanner is entered for the first time, or a value previously saved by
\fBYYSETSTATE (s)\fR\&. In the second case, the scanner will resume operations right after where the last
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
was called\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYLIMIT\fR
.RS 4
Expression of type
\fB* YYCTYPE\fR
that marks the end of the buffer (\fBYYLIMIT[\-1]\fR
is the last character in the buffer)\&. The generated code repeatedly compares
\fBYYCURSOR\fR
to
\fBYYLIMIT\fR
to determine when the buffer needs (re)filling\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYMARKER\fR
.RS 4
l\-value of type
\fB* YYCTYPE\fR\&. The generated code saves backtracking information in
\fBYYMARKER\fR\&. Some easy scanners might not use this\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYMAXFILL\fR
.RS 4
This will be automatically defined by
\fB/*!max:re2c*/\fR
blocks as explained above\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYSETCONDITION (c)\fR
.RS 4
This define is used to set the condition in transition rules\&. This is only being used when
\fB\-c\fR
is active and transition rules are being used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBYYSETSTATE (s)\fR
.RS 4
The user only needs to define this macro if the
\fB\-f\fR
flag was specified\&. In that case, the generated code \(lqcalls\(rq
\fBYYSETSTATE\fR
just before calling
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR\&. The parameter to
\fBYYSETSTATE\fR
is a signed integer that uniquely identifies the specific instance of
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
that is about to be called\&. Should the user wish to save the state of the scanner and have
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
return to the caller, all he has to do is store that unique identifer in a variable\&. Later, when the scannered is called again, it will call
\fBYYGETSTATE ()\fR
and resume execution right where it left off\&. The generated code will contain both
\fBYYSETSTATE (s)\fR
and
\fBYYGETSTATE\fR
even if
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
is being disabled\&.
.RE
.SH "SYNTAX"
.sp
Code for \fBre2c\fR consists of a set of \fIrules\fR, \fInamed definitions\fR and \fIinplace configurations\fR\&.
.sp
\fIrules\fR consist of a \fIregular\-expressions\fR along with a block of \fIC/C++ code\fR that is to be executed when the associated \fIregular\-expression\fR is matched\&. You can either start the code with an opening curly brace or the sequence \fB:=\fR\&. When the code with a curly brace then \fBre2c\fR counts the brace depth and stops looking for code automatically\&. Otherwise curly braces are not allowed and \fBre2c\fR stops looking for code at the first line that does not begin with whitespace\&. If two or more rules overlap, the first rule is preferred\&.
.sp
\fIregular\-expression\fR { \fIC/C++ code\fR }
.sp
\fIregular\-expression\fR := \fIC/C++ code\fR

\fB[^]\fR differs from \fB*\fR: \fB*\fR has the lowest priority, matches any code unit (either valid or invalid) and always consumes one character; \fB[^]\fR matches any valid code point (not code unit) and can consume multiple characters\&. In fact, when variable\-length encoding is used, \fB*\fR is the only possible way to match invalid input character\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
If \fB\-c\fR is active then each \fIregular\-expression\fR is preceeded by a list of comma separated condition names\&. Besides normal naming rules there are two special cases\&. A rule may contain the single condition name \fB*\fR and no contition name at all\&. In the latter case the rule cannot have a \fIregular\-expression\fR\&. Non empty rules may further more specify the new condition\&. In that case \fBre2c\fR will generated the necessary code to change the condition automatically\&. Just as above code can be started with a curly brace of the sequence \fB:=\fR\&. Further more rules can use \fB:=>\fR as a shortcut to automatically generate code that not only sets the new condition state but also continues execution with the new state\&. A shortcut rule should not be used in a loop where there is code between the start of the loop and the \fBre2c\fR block unless \fBre2c:cond:goto\fR is changed to \fBcontinue\fR\&. If code is necessary before all rule (though not simple jumps) you can doso by using \fB<!\fR pseudo\-rules\&.

.SH "SCANNER WITH STORABLE STATES"
.sp
When the \fB\-f\fR flag is specified, \fBre2c\fR generates a scanner that can store its current state, return to the caller, and later resume operations exactly where it left off\&.
.sp
The default operation of \fBre2c\fR is a \(lqpull\(rq model, where the scanner asks for extra input whenever it needs it\&. However, this mode of operation assumes that the scanner is the \(lqowner\(rq the parsing loop, and that may not always be convenient\&.
.sp
Typically, if there is a preprocessor ahead of the scanner in the stream, or for that matter any other procedural source of data, the scanner cannot \(lqask\(rq for more data unless both scanner and source live in a separate threads\&.
.sp
The \fB\-f\fR flag is useful for just this situation: it lets users design scanners that work in a \(lqpush\(rq model, i\&.e\&. where data is fed to the scanner chunk by chunk\&. When the scanner runs out of data to consume, it just stores its state, and return to the caller\&. When more input data is fed to the scanner, it resumes operations exactly where it left off\&.
.sp
When using the \fB\-f\fR option \fBre2c\fR does not accept stdin because it has to do the full generation process twice which means it has to read the input twice\&. That means \fBre2c\fR would fail in case it cannot open the input twice or reading the input for the first time influences the second read attempt\&.

The

these are declared as fields of the (C\e++) class of which the scanner is a method, so they do not need to be saved/restored explicitly\&. For C they could e\&.g\&. be made macros that select fields from a structure passed in as parameter\&. Alternatively, they could be declared as local variables, saved with
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
when it decides to return and restored at entry to the function\&. Also, it could be more efficient to save the state from
\fBYYFILL (n)\fR
because
\fBYYSETSTATE (state)\fR

.SH "SCANNER WITH CONDITION SUPPORT"
.sp
You can preceed regular expressions with a list of condition names when using the \fB\-c\fR switch\&. In this case \fBre2c\fR generates scanner blocks for each conditon\&. Where each of the generated blocks has its own precondition\&. The precondition is given by the interface define \fBYYGETCONDITON()\fR and must be of type \fBYYCONDTYPE\fR\&.
.sp
There are two special rule types\&. First, the rules of the condition \fB*\fR are merged to all conditions\&. And second the empty condition list allows to provide a code block that does not have a scanner part\&. Meaning it does not allow any regular expression\&. The condition value referring to this special block is always the one with the enumeration value 0\&. This way the code of this special rule can be used to initialize a scanner\&. It is in no way necessary to have these rules: but sometimes it is helpful to have a dedicated uninitialized condition state\&.
.sp
Non empty rules allow to specify the new condition, which makes them transition rules\&. Besides generating calls for the define \fBYYSETCONDTITION\fR no other special code is generated\&.
.sp
There is another kind of special rules that allow to prepend code to any code block of all rules of a certain set of conditions or to all code blocks to all rules\&. This can be helpful when some operation is common among rules\&. For instance this can be used to store the length of the scanned string\&. These special setup rules start with an exclamation mark followed by either a list of conditions \fB<! condition, \&.\&.\&. >\fR or a star \fB<!*>\fR\&. When \fBre2c\fR generates the code for a rule whose state does not have a setup rule and a star\(cqd setup rule is present, than that code will be used as setup code\&.
